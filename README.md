1. [`src/plots.ipynb`](src/plots.ipynb) contains the plotting script for all the experiment-related figures in the paper. It reads from [`src/results/`](src/results/) and generates figures into [`src/figures`](src/figures).
2. [`src/results/`](src/results/) contains all simulation results collected from **Quaint** and INET. 
3. [`src/figures`](src/figures) contains all figures about the experiments in the paper.
